# edit-cpp
trying my hand at cpp to make a term-based code editor

# day 0
have no idea how to even read file in (i'm so rusty)
got bones working to start displaying file
# TODO for working self-editing:
- save file
- typing mode
- cursor at right position during render
- window auto focusing the cursor
- tabs prolly?

# so I don't hate myself
- Makefile that isn't dumb
- copy paste
