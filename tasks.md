## TODO

- fix case: indentation

- expand current file name all the way?? experiment with how tabs are shown, maybe all i need are numbers??

- grepindex not set to 0 after every recalc

- fix blame getting calculated every render

- project based .editorconfig

- config based on filetype (would probably have to re-interpret config every file change bleh)

- indent_style tab or space

- make status bar based on % of maxX

- have two status bars?? one for file name and search, other for tabs (also could have a button that shows the name, and also only show the search when showSearch is on

- put asserts everywhere (make sure state is perfect and i never mess up)

## BRAINSTORMING

- try out having 1=9 as the only hotkeys??, maybe that's better to have it just show which ones are bound?? example: 1 . 2 . 4 5 . . . . so I know that 1, 2, 4, 5 are just bound. brainstorming hotkeys: X still clears all, g1-9 creates?? I'd love if shift+num could create just like starcraft but that clashes with every hotkey ever?? would clear up ctrl e, ctrl w, space, ctrl h, ctrl l. Would also break @ # $ % ^ * ( ) _. DEFINITELY DON"T BREAK MUSCLE MEMORY RIGHT NOW
