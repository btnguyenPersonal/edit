## TODO

- fix backspace weird stuff with dotCommand

- some way to fuzz again

- have configuration file
    - make a state->options object with all of the options, so the state is independant from the options
    - project based .editorconfig?? for different indent levels (and also using tabs instead of spaces)

- put asserts everywhere (make sure state is perfect and i never mess up)

## BRAINSTORMING

- try out having 1=9 as the only hotkeys??, maybe that's better to have it just show which ones are bound?? example: 1 . 2 . 4 5 . . . . so I know that 1, 2, 4, 5 are just bound. brainstorming hotkeys: X still clears all, g1-9 creates?? I'd love if shift+num could create just like starcraft but that clashes with every hotkey ever?? would clear up ctrl e, ctrl w, space, ctrl h, ctrl l. Would also break @ # $ % ^ * ( ) _. DEFINITELY DON"T BREAK MUSCLE MEMORY RIGHT NOW
