## TODO
- have configuration file

- render tabs as grey underscores
- word wrap
- for these above two, I need to separate the window calculations that we do to see if still on screen from just the state->data to be inside of the render function
    - currently thinks that it can just tell from the state->maxY maxX

- fix cursor for fileExplorer

- use all fixed with ints, will make look more professional, also have NASA asserts
