## TODO

- :retab command (find all preceding spaces of state->indent length and convert to tab)

- add all editorconfig settings

- change all of render to pixels

- put asserts everywhere (make sure state is perfect and i never mess up)

- fix diff function for huge files (look at vim, rope, other stuff)

- go line by line, and do a code review of everything on github (especially the llm crap i have in here)
