 ## TODO
 
+- lock down changing files flag
+	- turn on when unsaved??
+
+- look at how hard it would be to have an icon at top to say there are new changes available?
+	- each action check? if new changes happen have a popup like vim??
+
+- fix gj gk same as vim
+
+- use as mutt email maker (figure out how that works)
+	- also remember to add muttrc to dotfiles
+
 - add args
+	- turn off autosave cmd
 	-c "commands" (need to make parser for <c-h> <cr> etc)
 	--help
 	-h
 
 - add gitlab and local server as mirror
 
-- :retab command (find all preceding spaces of state->indent length and convert to tab)
-
-- add all editorconfig settings
+- fix editorconfig filename parser
 
 - put asserts everywhere (make sure state is perfect and i never mess up)
 
-- change keybinds to how dwm does it
-
 - fix diff function for huge files (look at vim, rope, other stuff)
-
-- go line by line, and do a code review of everything on github (especially the llm crap i have in here)
+	- futures api probably bad, use <pthread> semaphores and locks
+	- do this with tests!!
+	- have specific timestamps, and make a logging function that shows what happened when (with locks)
